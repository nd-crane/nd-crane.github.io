# Tutorial

This tutorial will gide you with setting up the framework and running a simple model.
Begin by [installing Git](#) and [installing Python](#), if needed.
Using the command line, type the following to create a new directory for the new project:

    mkdir ai-tutorial

Enter the new directory and initialize PDM. (Don't type the `$` character—it is used to indicate what you should type into the command prompt)

    $ cd ai-tutorial
    $ pdm init
    Creating a pyproject.toml for PDM...
    Please enter the Python interpreter to use
    0. /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
    1. /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
    2. /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9 (3.9)
    3. /Users/dbrower/.pyenv/versions/3.9.10/bin/python3.9 (3.9)
    4. /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3 (3.9)
    Please select (0): 0
    Using Python interpreter: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
    Would you like to create a virtualenv with /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10? [y/n] (y): y
    Virtualenv is created successfully at ./ai-tutorial/.venv
    Is the project a library that will be uploaded to PyPI [y/n] (n): n
    License(SPDX name) (MIT):
    Author name (Jane Doe):
    Author email (jdoe@example.com):
    Python requires('*' to allow any) (>=3.10):
    Changes are written to pyproject.toml.

PDM has a few prompts.
You can see the answers in the text above.
For the python version, use the one that you had previously installed—usually the first option. So we chose `0`.
Then type `y` to set up a virtualenv.
Then type `n` since this is not going to be a PyPI library.
For the next four options, press Enter to choose the defaults.

Now lets create a machine learning model.
Open a text editor and save the following as the file `model.py`

```python
#!/bin/env python

# enter simple pytorch model
```

Lets create a new git repository for this model.

    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /ai-tutorial/.git/
    $ git add pyproject.toml model.py
    $ git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    [main (root-commit) 7fc208a] Initial Commit
     1 file changed, 14 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 pyproject.toml
     create mode 100644 model.py
    ```

Now lets grab some training data.
(Which training data?)

Lets set up DVC and add this data to it.
(Set up a local remote.)

    pdm dvc ...
