# Framework 

## Introduction

Any trusted AI T&E (TODO: define) must consider the problems of deployment in mission ciritical applications in addition to the usual measurment of success based on measurment of training accuracy.
The T&E Framework Infrastructure project provides a framework for connecting the various components and toolboxes being developed for the Trusted AI project together into a single coherent system.

The system provides standardized methods for storage and version control of code, data and documentation.
There is a minimum viable vocabulary to describe experiments, as well as metadata and storage criterion for model/data outputs such as Neural Network weights.

Preference is given to Open Source Software and Tools that can either be integrated into the Framework or modified by our software development teams with possible contribution back to their parent project.

## Overview

The core of the framework is the version control system [Git] and the storage overlay provided by the [Data Version Control][dvc] (DVC) project.
All model code, data preperation code, and training workflows are tracked in as a Git Repository.
Training data, generated models, and analytics are tracked by DVC.
DVC provides a way to track file versions in Git, but store the contents elseware.
This is useful since training data and models tend to be large and numerious, both things that become a liability when stored directly in a Git repository.

Workflow steps?

## Installation and Set Up

The framework requires [Python] to operate.
If you don't have a recent version of python installed, see the section [Installing Python](#installing-python).
(To find the version of python you have installed run `python3 -V`. The output should be at least 3.10)

Once Python is installed, set up your git project.

Install [git].

### Installing Python

Python is installed differently depending on the operating system on your computer.

 * **MacOS** Easist way is with [Homebrew].
    ```
    $ brew install pyenv
    $ pyenv install 3.10.6
    ```
 * **Linux**...how?
 * **Windows**...no idea


### Set Up Repository

All AI projects are expected to be in a Git repository.
If there isn't already one set up, make a new one by creating a new directory, installing PDM, and then using `git init` to initialize a new git repository. The detailed steps follows.
There are also many guides online if you want more information, especially on [using Git][github-git].

1. Create a new directory for the project  `mkdir my-ai-project`
2. Enter the directory `cd my-ai-project`
3. Set up [PDM] `pip install --user pdm`
4. Initialize PDM
    ```$ pdm init
    Creating a pyproject.toml for PDM...
    Please enter the Python interpreter to use
    0. /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
    1. /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
    2. /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9 (3.9)
    3. /Users/dbrower/.pyenv/versions/3.9.10/bin/python3.9 (3.9)
    4. /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3 (3.9)
    Please select (0): 0
    Using Python interpreter: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
    Would you like to create a virtualenv with /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10? [y/n] (y): y
    Virtualenv is created successfully at ./my-ai-ptoject/.venv
    Is the project a library that will be uploaded to PyPI [y/n] (n): n
    License(SPDX name) (MIT): 
    Author name (Jane Doe): 
    Author email (jdoe@example.com): 
    Python requires('*' to allow any) (>=3.10): 
    Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
    ```
5. Set up the Git repo
    ```$ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /my-ai-ptoject/.git/
    ```
6. Make the first commit
    ```
    $ git add pyproject.toml
    $ git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    [main (root-commit) 7fc208a] Initial Commit
     1 file changed, 14 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 pyproject.toml
    ```

### Install DVC

Since the [PDM] pacakge manager is installed, we can use that to install DVC:

```
$ pdm add dvc
Adding packages to default dependencies: dvc
ðŸ”’ Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working set with lock file: 85 to add, 0 to update, 0 to remove

ðŸŽ‰ All complete!
```



Configure DVC with remotes.
